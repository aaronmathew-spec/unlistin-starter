# Project Docs

Welcome! This docs section ships with the app and is built with **MDX**.

- **Scaffolding CLI**: `npm run generate <slice> -- --kind=all`
- **CI**: typecheck, lint, test, build on push/PR to `main`
- **Conventions**:
  - Strict TypeScript
  - RLS + signed URLs on data access
  - Activity feed for auditable actions
